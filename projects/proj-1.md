The primary goal of the project is to create a machine learning model to predict a patient's diagnosis of diabetes. The data is focused on patients staying in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because ICU's often lack verified medical histories for new patients. The patient may not be coherent enough to give information on their medical history and it can take time for the ICU to recieve their records - time the patient might not have. Knowing if the patient has diabetes sooner can improve the patient's outcome by allowing the ICU to make adjustments to their care based on this knowledge.

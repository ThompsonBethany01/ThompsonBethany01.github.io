This team project was our Codeup capstone - a culmination of what we learned during our time at the Data Science career accelerator program. We used Spotify's API to acquire data on thousands of songs. To discover the science behind the art of music, we explored and statistically tested what features influenced a song's popularity. We then created a model to predict how popular a song is based on these key insights found.
